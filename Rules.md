# Rules of Sequence

## Objective

* **2 Players/Teams:** Be the first to form **two** "Sequences."
* **3 Players/Teams:** Be the first to form **one** "Sequence."
* **Definition:** A Sequence is a connected series of **5 chips** of the same color in a straight line (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).

## Setup

1. **Teams:** Players divide evenly into 2 or 3 teams. Teammates must alternate seating positions around the board (e.g., Team A, Team B, Team A, Team B).
2. **Deal:** Shuffle the deck (2 full decks combined) and deal cards based on player count:
* **2 players:** 7 cards each
* **3-4 players:** 6 cards each
* **6 players:** 5 cards each
* **8-9 players:** 4 cards each
* **10-12 players:** 3 cards each


3. **Draw Pile:** Place remaining cards face down.

## Gameplay

Turns move clockwise. On your turn:

1. **Play a Card:** Select a card from your hand and place it face-up in your personal discard pile.
2. **Place a Chip:** Place a chip of your color on one of the two corresponding spaces on the game board.
3. **Draw a Card:** Draw a new card from the deck.
* *Penalty:* If you forget to draw before the next player places their chip, you lose the right to draw and must finish the game with fewer cards.



## Special Cards

* **Red Jacks (Wild):** Hearts and Diamonds. Can be played to place a chip on **any** open space on the board.
* **Black Jacks (Remove):** Clubs and Spades. Can be played to **remove** one of the opponent's chips from the board.
* *Restriction:* You cannot remove a chip that is part of a completed Sequence.



## Board Features

* **Free Spaces (Corners):** The four corner spaces are "printed chips" relevant to all players. They count as a chip of your color. You only need 4 of your own chips connected to a corner to complete a Sequence.
* **Dead Cards:** If you hold a card where both corresponding board spaces are already covered (by any player), it is a "Dead Card." You may reveal it on your turn, discard it, draw a new card, and then take your normal turn.

## Winning

* The game ends immediately when a player or team completes the required number of Sequences.
* **Intersecting Sequences:** You may use one chip from your first Sequence as part of your second Sequence.
* **No Table Talk:** Coaching teammates is not allowed. If a player coaches, every member of that team must discard a card.
